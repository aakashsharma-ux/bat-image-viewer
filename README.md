# Bat-Viewer

A Batman-themed image gallery viewer. Paste up to 1,000 image URLs, view them in a responsive grid, and adjust image size dynamically — all in the browser with no backend.

- Frosted-glass UI over Batman grunge background
- Back-to-top button
- Append mode to accumulate across multiple loads
- Fully responsive (5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 columns)

## Local Development

No build step needed. Just open `index.html` directly in any browser:

```bash
# Option 1 — open directly
open index.html

# Option 2 — simple local server (avoids any file:// quirks)
npx serve .
# or
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

## Usage

1. Paste one or more image URLs into the text area (one per line or comma-separated)
2. Click **Load Images** — previous images are automatically cleared
3. Use the **Image Size** slider (top-right) to resize all cards at once
4. Check **Append to existing** if you want to add to the current gallery instead of replacing it
5. Click **Copy Link** on any card to copy its URL
6. Click **Remove** to delete a single card
